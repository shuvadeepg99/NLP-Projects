Assignment 1:
A project on natural language processing condicting the following tasks:
    1. Implementing the naive bayes classifier for sentiment analysis of IMDB review
    2. Making a wordembeddingops class to perform vector algebra using word embeddings created using word2vec pre trained word embedding
    3. Implemented logistic regression to train the bag of words text classifier, word2vec classifier and conducted the same exercise of sentiment analysis

Assignment 2:
    Built an N-gram model and trained on a dataset having the name of cities as training corpora. 

Implemented n gram model to generate the next word in the sequence by taking previous n-1 tokens as context words to generate next possible words.

Implemented a feed forward neural network and RNN to process the sequence of tokens and output next possible words. Use of RNNs enhance the performance of the language models and capture the coherence between the generated words in a better manner.

Calculated perplexity to evaluate the accuracy of the generated next words.
